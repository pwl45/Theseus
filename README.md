# Theseus and the Minotaur

Theseus is trapped within the mythical Labyrinth, forced to contend with the ferocious Minotaur.  The Minotaur is faster than Theseus, but has severely limited intelligence.  Thus, for every square Theseus moves, the Minotaur will have the opportunity to move twice. However, the Minotaur's movement capabilities are limited to the following:

### If the Minotaur can move horizontally towards Theseus, he will do so.  
### Otherwise, if the Minotaur can move vertically towards Theseus, he will do so.  
### Finally, if the Minotaur can do neither, he will pass his turn.

In an open field, the Minotaur would outrun Theseus and eat him every time.  However, the maze-like structure of the Labyrinth, coupled with the Minotaur's inefficient and predictable movement pattern, allows Theseus to trap the Minotaur behind walls and make his way safely to the exit. 

**Controls:**
Use the arrow keys to move.  If Theseus desires, he can also pass his turn with the key z.  Choosing to pass may seem useless, but doing so at the right moments is critical to completing certain levels.  
Move on to the next level by reaching the green dot.  



**Notes:**
-There are 20 levels total.  More may be added in the future. 
-Things start to get hard around level 10
-I still don't know how to beat level 15, so if anyone figures it out, please let me know.  

"Theseus and the Minotaur" mazes were originally designed by game designer Robert Abbott.  
Levels adapted from Kristanix's PC game "Theseus and the Minotaur."
